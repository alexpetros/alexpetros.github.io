        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <p>This website contains no JavaScript. This is not because I dislike JavaScript (I actually think it's very good at what it does) but because I believe you deserve to have spaces on the web that do you nothing more than what you asked from them. Most likely you came here to read words on a screen, so I will give you that and only that. If I add interactive elements later, I will explicitly note them.</p>
        <p>I have done my best to use semantically-appropriate HTML that meets web accessibility standards. If you use assitive technology to access this website and there is something I can do to improve that experience, please reach out.</p>
