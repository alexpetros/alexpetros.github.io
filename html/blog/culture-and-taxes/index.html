<h1>Culture Doesn't Have To Happen Where You Pay Your Teaxes</h1>
<!-- <h1>Or, the fast and slow internet</h1> -->

My friend <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/gmail-fediverse-looms">Ryan</a> has a successful newsletter called <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day,</a> about the internet and culture.
A couple months ago, <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/gmail-fediverse-looms">he wrote this:</a>

<blockquote>
I oscillate between thinking websites are the magazines of the 21st century — an antiquated luxury item that will only be appreciated by a select few — or the true atomic unit of the internet, sidelined by a 15-year side quest into social, that will soon be rediscovered and reinvigorated.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's extremely funny that this trenchant insight was prompted by Pharrell Williams doing a website launch for <a href="https://blackyachtrock.com/"><cite>Black Yacht Rock</cite></a>, and when I started writing this piece I thought that was totally beside the point.
But I was wrong.
There's a tectonic rupture happening on the internet right now—you feel it, I feel it, and Pharrell Williams feels it.

<p>
And it has everything to do with <cite>Black Yacht Rock.</cite>

  <h2>The Internet vs The Web</h2>
  <p>
  The internet is a global communications infrastructure.
  Your cell phone connects the internet, as does your laptop, any modern game console, and any modern TV.
  These devices have apps that use all the internet in lots of different ways: to download updates, to stream movies and music, to play multiplayer games online, and so on.

  <p>
  The web exists on the internet, but it's a much more specific thing.
  The web is, well, websites.
  When you a click a link, and end up in a web browser like Chrome or Safari or Firefox, you're on the web.
  Websites can be opened in different tabs, can be shared with others using a link, and can be viewed on pretty much any device.

  <p>
  For most people, this is a distinction without a difference: whether it's an app or a website, what matters is that it's doing something online.
  But apps and websites have very different economic, political, and cultural implications that this piece is going to discuss in-depth, and if you want to understand the future of the internet, you'll need to know them too.

<h2>Early Years</h2>

<p>
When the internet first went mainstream, we did everything on websites.
WWW dot something dot com.
The first boom and bust cycle of the internet was named after websites: the dotcom bubble.
Lots of business tried to start up online.
Many of these businesses failed, a few succeeded, and mom always regretted not buying Amazon stock.
All of this internet is happening on desktop computers (and laptops); all of this is happening on the web.
This is the internet's pangea stage.

<p>
A bit after the dotcom bubble bursts, another major use-case for the internet whirs to life: gaming.
The PlayStation 2 can connect to the internet with a network adapter, and the Xbox launches with Xbox Live; no major console will ever ship without internet capabilities again.
The internet also quickly supplants the previous way people played desktop computer games against each other—putting lots of desktop computers in the same room—because it is vastly more convenient and cost-effective.

<p>
And, finally, people also download programs on their computer that use the internet to connect directly to other people's computers. They use these programs to share multimedia and unleash an avalanche of piracy that almost buries the music industry.
After a series of lawsuits and threatening letters to teenagers, this settles down a bit and the music industry accommodates to the new reality that they will have to distribute their music online, largely through iTunes.

<p>
Let's pause here, in roughly 2006.
The Nintendo Wii has just been announced.
The most cutting-edge smartphone is the Blackberry Trio.
Charlie has yet to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EqSXDwTq6U">bite the finger</a>.
The author of this piece is 9 years old.

<p>
I want to emphasize what, at this stage, is and isn't a website.

<p>
Google, MySpace, GeoCities, 4Chan, Yahoo Answers—these are all websites, and you visit them in the web browser.
<!-- When people want to talk to each other online, the primary way they do so is by opening a web browser on their computer (likely Internet Explorer) and navigating to their preferred websites. -->
<!-- Online culture, at this stage, almost entirely comprises websites. -->

<!-- <aside> -->
<!--   <p> -->
<!--   For some of my readers, I know this is obvious to the point of being pedantic—stick with me. -->
<!-- </aside> -->
The big internet-connected games, like World of Warcraft or Call of Duty, are <em>not</em> websites; they are different applications on your computer (or disks in your console) that also connect to the internet.
Peer-to-peer torrents like Napster, LimeWire, etc., are also not really on the web;
you find out about them on websites, but then you use a different application to do the downloading.
Legitimate music purchases are also happening via applications like iTunes, and, mostly, not on websites.

<p>
But, interestingly, these non-website internet activities are <em>also</em> happening on websites, just less effectively.
Websites can only deliver pretty rudimentary games—browsers certainly can't handle World of Warcraft—but they are cheap to make and easy to distribute.
Neopets, Runescape, and a murderer's row of of Flash games (on websites like Newgrounds and Miniclip) all take off during this period.
It's slow and ineffective to download a bunch of mp3s in a web browser, but it can be done.

<p>
And then two massive changes happened.

<h2>The Social Meteor</h2>

<p>
It's somewhat interesting to imagine a world where social media and the modern smartphone didn't happen simultaneously, but they did.
Maybe they had to.
I think this scrambled a lot of people's understanding of the internet in ways we're only just starting to recover from.

  By the way, I grew up with all of this and I had to become a software engineer—the kind of deeply dorky software engineer who <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/custom-html-has-levels/">blogs about HTML</a>—before I had the grammar to describe it.
  This piece is my attempt to bring that grammar out of the engineering world, not just for your understanding, but also my own.

Two years ago, in <cite class=article><a href="/blog/death-of-the-social-network">The Easiest Moment in Human History to Plan a Party</a></cite>, I wrote about about how Facebook gradually shifted from a social network to a social media platform, the key difference being that social networks care about who know, and social media cares what you like:

<blockquote>
   [Social media's] reason for existing is to conflate the social connections I want to maintain with the entertainment I want to consume. Your social graph is only useful insofar as it can be weaponized to make you horrifically afraid that some essential component of your actual human relationships will be lost if you ever close the app.
</blockquote>

<p>
I now believe that this was only made possible by the invention of a new internet delivery mechanism: the phone app.

<p>
It never made much sense to have a desktop application specifically for Facebook.
Websites are easier to make than desktop applications, and they are easier to share with other people, so Facebook started as website.
You logged on, saw what your friends were up to, and then did something else.

<p>
For lots of reasons, a website (on your desktop or on your phone) can never capture enough of your attention support a profitable social media—the total addressable market is too small.
A phone app has access to much bigger pool of attention to capture—all of it.

<p>
The internet used to be a thing that you log on to;
the iPhone made it into a thing that tells you—at any time, in any place—when it's time to log on.

<p>
Social media created a kind of colony collapse.
We simply lost the ecosystem to sustain an internet culture that was distributed across millions of websites.
In fact, this is really the first time that we start talking about "internet culture" as a concept. The reduced internet surface area (in terms of number of websites) gives people the impression that they are looking at all of it, and that is is possible to draw some conclusions from their sample.
