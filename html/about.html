<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
Alex Petros is a writer and software engineer from Miami, Florida.
He currently lives in New York City.
His website is a work-in-progress.

<h1>Disabling JavaScript</h1>
<p>
This website contains very little JavaScript.
This is not because I dislike JavaScript (I actually think it's very good at what it does) but because I believe you deserve to have spaces on the web that do you nothing more than what you asked from them.
Most likely you came here to read words on a screen, so I will give you that and only that.
I occasionally use embeds or interactive features, but if you would like to disable JavaScript your experience on this website should be near-identical.

<h1>Link Rot</h1>
<p>
Circumstances permitting, I am committed to maintaining the links to the homepage and the blog posts.
So <a href="https://thefloatingcontinent.com/blog/death-of-the-social-network">https://thefloatingcontinent.com/blog/death-of-the-social-network</a> is safe to link to, but <a href="https://thefloatingcontinent.com/about">https://thefloatingcontinent.com/about</a> might change.

<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>
I have done my best to use semantically-appropriate HTML that meets web accessibility standards.
If you use assitive technology to access this website and there is something I can do to improve that experience, please reach out.
